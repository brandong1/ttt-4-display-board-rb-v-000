# Define display_board that accepts a board and prints
# out the current state.

def display_board(board)
  board = [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "]
  puts "#{board[0]}",
end


#Instructions said copy my board from previous lesson
#Board from previous lesson:
# def display_board
#  puts "   |   |   \n-----------\n   |   |   \n-----------\n   |   |   \n"
# 
# end
#
# This is completely different than what the lesson says the board[] should be:
# board = [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "]
#
#I'm still not sure how my other board passed as I had to google how to start a new line since \n hasn't been intoduced yet..
